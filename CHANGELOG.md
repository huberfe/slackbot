**Warning**

`update` button which will redirect you to Slack Authentication as a fresh bot install.

# Version 2.0.0 announcement
This new version is compatible with SeAT 2.x. I choose to follow SeAT major version in order to make life easiest for maintainers.

Slack RTM has been replaced by Slack Event API which is easier to set than using a Daemon.

Due to this change, Slackbot is no longer processing **Team Invitation**. Team invitation is a non official endpoint which is only usable with test token, and Slack Event require official OAuth token.

**Warning**
> You have to create new credentials in `Slackbot Settings` (follow the link bellow credentials fields).

> Slackbot namespace has changed for `Warlof\Seat\Slackbot` and Slack credentials are now stored into official `Seat` setting table.

> Supervisor configuration related to Slackbot Daemon is non longer required

Redis is now used in order to reduce call amount through Slack REST API.

# Version 0.7.5
Handle `Team Invitation` exception in logs in order to avoid to barely spam SeAT stats with unrelevant exception.
Introduce a new event kind called "sync" into which those exception are published.

# Version 0.7.4
Add a constraint into `slack:users:update` command which exclude `slackbot` from valid users. It appears that `slackbot` is not considered as a bot by Slack API.
We're waiting for a ticket issue response from Slack Team related to this bug.

# Version 0.7.3
Add a local channels clear which will delete no longer valid channels to the command `slack:channels:update` if there is an issue with the daemon.

# Version 0.7.2
remove MPM channels from private channels list

# Version 0.7.0
fix log issues which was logging event even when they didn't happen.
rename slack command
exclude general channel from member list and add general flag to channels

**Warning**
> This update is an upgrade and need a migration. Run `php artisan migrate` command in order to update schemas.

> This update replace `slack:update:channels` and `slack:update:users` with `slack:channels:update`
and `slack:users:update` respectively.

> Due to latest modification, you need to run `slack:channels:update` command in order to update your `slack_channels`
flags.

the OAuth credentials has been temporarily disabled waiting an answer from Slack support.

In order to provide you a way to keep using the bot, the old connection method has been restored (using testing token).

You need to update the token using the test token and reload supervisor.

Sincere regrets for this perturbation.
